This code imitates the Promodoro Timer. It could help you to organize your working time and your breaks.

Firstly it counts down from 25 minutes if you click on the Start button. Then it gives you a 5 minutes long break. This counts as a whole working session and it will be marked on the window with a check mark sign.

Every time when the timer counts down a working session it adds a plus check mark sign to the existing ones if there is any.

This repeats itself 3 times and at the 4th times, after the 25 minutes work time it counts down from a 20 minutes long break.

The whole process repeats itself. If you want to reset the timer to the initial state, click on the Reset button.
